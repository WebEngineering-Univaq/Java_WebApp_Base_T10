# BaseWebApp-T10
> Base project for a Java web application deployed on Tomcat 10

This is the skeleton of a Java web application (with a sample servlet) running on JAkartaEE 9 and Tomcat 10
 
## Usage

This is a *sample application* developed during the lectures of the  [**Web Engineering course**](https://people.disim.univaq.it/~dellapenna/content.php?page=students). The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 9th lecture of the course, so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*

## Installation

This is a Maven-based project. Simply download the code and open it in any Maven-enabled IDE such as Netbeans or Eclipse. Additionally, you may need to *configure the deploy settings*: the application is intended to be run on the **JakartaEE 9** platform inside **Apache Tomcat version 10**. Refer to your IDE help files to perform this step. For example, in Apache Netbeans, you must enter these settings in Project properties > Run.
